For Designing n-bit Ripple Carry Adder the output carry has the value 2^n
	if two n bit numbers sums up to 2^n then sum_output = 0 and carry_ouput = 1

the Full Adder and the Half Adder Has been Created Seperately and both the adders
are working correctly

8-bit adder is implemented with 8 seperate Full Adders
16-bit adder is implemented with two 8 bit adders
32-bit adder is implemented with two 16 bit adders
64-bit adder is implemented with two 32 bit adders
